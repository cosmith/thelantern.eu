I'm not familiar with violence. Other men might brawl in the streets on the way home from football matches, put a pit-bull and a cat inside a telephone booth together to make them fight, or even film the killings of other men without even flinching. Others are violent, and their violence seems, truthfully, so peculiar to me that I feel I'll never be able to understand it.

One day, I heard a man talking in the gentlest voice. Jean Vanier's gentleness is so sensitive, it emanates so clearly from him that you can almost see it. And here is what he said: 'living with handicapped people has made me aware of my own violence.' And he recounted how one supersensitive individual was driving him crazy, up to the desire for violence, with his melodramatic reactions. Or how he was pushed to the edge by an individual become especially violent because of what life had thrown at him.

Our violence arises from contact with others who act violently. We insult people who have insulted us; we hate people who don't like us; we aren't tolerant towards the intolerant. Which is what makes other people more abusive still, more filled with hate, more intolerant. Which in turn makes us more abusive, filled with hate and intolerant. And each individual thinks at the end of this vicious cycle: 'If only he didn't exist!'

Meek people are needed to combat violence. True meek individuals who are aware of their inner violence and no longer seek vengeance upon others, who are able to detect the fallacies within their own bursts of hatred. Those who simply pretend to be meek risk being dragged back down the spiral.
