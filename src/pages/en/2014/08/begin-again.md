Society is buckling under the weight of accusation. The progressives have accused society of being an old lady attached to futile passions. The conservatives, on the other hand, perceive society as some crazy machine without any direction. And people who don’t understand their own unease accuse society over and over again, as its enemy, for right and for wrong. Yet society isn’t extraneous to us, we are part of it. We are society. Accusing society is accusing us. By basking in accusation, we accept our own wrongs and prevent ourselves from escaping them. It’s not enough to look at the wrong, and it’s not enough to describe it, even shrewdly. So instead of renouncing our critical thinking, let’s use it for new beginnings. New beginnings are already in development, and intuitions are already in place: just take a look around you. Accept feeling a little lost at times and uncertain of global direction. And let’s accept that the future might not be exactly how we dreamt it was going to be. All it takes is believing in our ability to create new beginnings, refusing to be enclosed, and being ready to see and participate in the arising of the unexpected. Perhaps we’re complaining, but at least it’s for a re-birth.

The young European generation is not yet left to gloom, at least not permanently. We have to speak carefully, of course, as we are tired of the false hope of spectacular promises and bright tomorrows to come. We should no longer plunge into historical processes without knowing their value. Thus we should look carefully, and try to distinguish right from wrong, and if we find only embers under the ashes, we ought to be content with that and try to relight the fire.

Dialogue is what we need: thinking alone rarely suffices, and because the division of society into groups unable to understand and communicate with each other is painful. Dialogue is needed, surpassing national borders, political clans and spiritual differences. We need to be peaceful, take our time if necessary, to prevent aggravating our disagreements, and to refrain from anger, which seems to be the prerequisite for society debates whereas it reveals more often personal tribulations than the confidence of a thought for its own sake.

Patient attentiveness should replace this anger in an effort to sow the seeds of renewal. These seeds are not easy to conceive, as their fruits are not visible yet, and may never be visible, and will only become visible if cautious cultivators take care of them. We should look for them with an eye detached from old habits of thinking, whilst accepting that we won’t have perfect vision, but remaining hopeful and ready to act. We want to be part of a generation of new beginnings.
